# Planning amd strategy
The day we were givien the project, I remembered the the way I used to mange my tasks when I was studying the university.
It all started when I started the university and was not able to keep up with work. At this time my sister suggested buying a white board that divides the importance my task. 
This suggestion helped me succeed and improved my grades significantly. Therefore, I decided to make the IMT app which stands for important-tasks. Some, of the problem that 
I faced was that when I made the logic for the calendar. The problem was that I did not include a check for the day which made the app not see the current month which I discovered
while I was trying to break the app. The way to get it solved was to add an if statment to check for the day. Another problem, that I faced was changing the color based on  the user
preference when data were filtter, but color was not changed according to the level of importance. The way to solve it was to add a when stament to change the color accordingly
#  unsolved problems
one of the unsolved problems was that when adding many task, the app starts to uncheck and check other boxes randomly 

#  favorite functions
One of my favorite features would be the emoji that showa if tasks are due or not as well as the changing of color based on the importance
